					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The main challenge of this lab was making sure we understood the purpose of fuctions and how to use them in 
						javascript code.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We encountered a few issues. First, we we're unable to properly sort the strings, and the function returned the strings
						as the same string as the input. Second, the pop-up prompt shows up twice before being properly outputed, however the
						outout would be correct. 
					</p>
