					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to use JavaSCript to add elements with a 
						specific class to a specific section in our html file.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We had few problems with this section, mostly caused by a few errant keystrokes. 
						One issue was caused by forgetting to add a "#" symbol in front of our button identifier 
						and it wasn't linked together as a result. Other than that most of what we troubleshooted 
						was getting the css to look nice. </p>
