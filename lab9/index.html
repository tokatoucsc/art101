			<h1>Lab 9 - Libraries and jQuery</h1>
			<div id="challenge" class>
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to load in a jQuery library and use its features to create buttons to modify text.</p>			</div>

			<div id="Problems" class>
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We had a few problems with the lab, first getting the buttons to appear which we found out was due to having the wrong class set up in this section. 
                        This was fixed by relabelling our divs into the proper form which allowed our jQuery scripts to append buttons and properly link. 
                        We had issues getting the css changes working properly since some appeared to be overwritten by the other css attached in it, 
                        however we "fixed" this by making the changes of the button affect seperate css elements.</p>
