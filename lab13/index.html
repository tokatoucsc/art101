			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to use loops in order to
						create a javascript program that would iterate a semi-complex task
						from 0 to 200.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Since we did this lab in class fairly recently, there also werent
						many orobles we had to deal with for this lab. One issue we did have
						was trying to loml the button we made with the function, but a workaround
						for this was jsut setting the loop as an anonymous function.
