			<h1>Lab 15 - AJAX</h1>

					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to use an AJAX call to get an output from an API, of which we used
                        the Jeopardy one.
                    </p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We had a few problems connecting the API to the JavaScript file. The first was just unfamiliarity using AJAX since it is 
                        something neither of us had done before. However, using the "recipe" from Canvas we got the hang of it. Secondly, we had 
                        some issues trying to pull data from the API. This error turned out to be due to the fact that Jeopardy API sent its objects
                        nestled in arrays, and since we were only using one pull, this meant we received an object nestled in a 1 length array. Once 
                        we figured this out, we changed our code and were able to call our data from the API and complete the lab.
                    </p>
