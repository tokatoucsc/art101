					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to use both anonymous functions and callbacks to perform operations on an array of numbers
                        within the console. 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We had a few errors in writing our code properly to call our anonymous functions but were able to figure it out. Otherise
                        it was a rather smooth sailing lab. </p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
                    <p>Take a peek at your console from your inspect menu.</p>
