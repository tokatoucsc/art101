			<h1>Lab 16 - JSON and APIs</h1>

					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of the lab was to use an API for XKCD comics to display the comic
						in our index, then use AJAX to retrieve the comics object data and use those value pairs
						to attribute the appropriate keys to the image.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>There were quite a few problems with this lab. The base of getting an object from an API and adding it to a div was easy enough
						however for the xkcd api of the assingment both my partner and I encountered a CORS error when attempting to access the 
						endpoint from our JavaScript file. Looking online it looked as though we couldn't find a fix for this, but searching github for
						anyone else who might've solved the issue led us to the someone who made a API of the original link and uploaded it onto 
						github for us to luckily use. We have included a link to that below. After that we were able to get the object and 
						store it properly but encountered another error while trying to add the alt as to the image. For whatever reason, it would 
						initially be added with each word in the string acting as it's own tag in the html of our website. To fix this we used single 
						quotation marks which embedded double quotation marks to surround the variable within the necessary quotation marks to 
						properly mark it as a full string by html. Other than the essay written above, it was smooth sailing :smile:</p>
